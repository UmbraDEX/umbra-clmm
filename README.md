Umbra-CLMM is a concentrated liquidity market maker (CLMM) program built for the Eclipse ecosystem.

**Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM)** pools allow liquidity providers to select a specific price range at which liquidity is active for trades within a pool. This is in contrast to constant product Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools, where all liquidity is spread out on a price curve from 0 to âˆž. For LPs, CLMM design enables capital to be deployed with higher efficiency and earn increased yield from trading fees. For traders, CLMMs improve liquidity depth around the current price which translates to better prices and lower price impact on swaps. CLMM pools can be configured for pairs with different volatility.
